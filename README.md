# RSA
security project includes communication between sender and receiver with RSA encryption algorithm and breaking it with CCA (chosen cipher attack) and mathematical attack using python socket
# to use you need to run first:
pip install sockets

pip install matplotlib

pip install sympy
# to stablish communication 
run receiver.py then sender.py
# to test attacks 
run attacks.py

1 => mathematical attack

2 => chosen cipher attack
